# Number Guessing Game

This project is a simple number guessing game written in Python. The game asks the player to guess a random number within a specified range. 
The player has a limited number of attempts, calculated based on the range size, to guess the number correctly.

To play the game, you will be prompted to enter a lower and an upper bound for the number range. The game will then calculate the number of 
guesses you have based on these bounds. Your goal is to guess the correct number within these attempts. After each guess, the game will tell 
you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. This game is compatible with Python 3.x.

This project was created as a learning exercise in Python programming. While I am not actively seeking contributions, feedback and suggestions are welcome. Feel free to fork the project and experiment with your own ideas.
